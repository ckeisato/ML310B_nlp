    "For this assignment, we want to use sentiment analysis to predict the polarity of a given film review.  To build the model, we are given a corpus of 50K reviews, each associated with a score of 0 or 1, which respectively indicate that the review is negative or positive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metrics used\n",
    "We will use accuracy as the main metric used to determine if the model is successful.  But, throughout the model training and cross validation, the proportion of false positives for both classes will be monitored.\n"

    "#### Methodology\n",
    "The data transformed by using TFIDIF then fed into a Logistic Regression classifier.  I am using a test train split of 30% and 70%.  The model is run with data that is processed with different ngram lengths and minimum document frequency values.  I am also using the SKlearn cross validation module to test different parameters for the Logistic Regression model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the Logistic Regression model because this is a supervised learning problem with binary labels.  I also tried running an SVM model but it took too long to run on my machine with the complete dataset.  Using a decision tree was also considered but the dataset seemed too sparse to use that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, the minimium document frequency is varied while the maximum document frequency remains constant at 0.9.  The model is tested against the following min_df values: 0.0001, 0.00025, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.0025.  I chose to vary the minimum value instead of the maximum value because I assumed that would reduce the instances of non words in the dataset as well as reducing noise.  However, I am interested in the effect that changing the max_df would have as well.  The n-grams value is also varied, using values between 1 and 4.  I did not go beyond (1, 3) because using a smaller portion of data, I was not seeing a significant difference in results after categorizing words using n-grams greater than 3.  After processing this data, if the transformed TFIDIF matrix had more features than instances, I would not run the model.  This was done because when running the model on such a matrix (with a subset of data) there was performance degredation, which was likely due to the Logistic Regression classifier not handling datasets with more features than rows well.  \n",
    "- Reducing the feature spacing using the sklearn Truncated SVD module was also considered.  However, in the documentation, the suggested value for n_components is 100, and when I ran the model with that parameter set as 200, the accuracy remained flat.  I believe this is because the same 200 n-grams were being selected for each run.  Some variation of PCA is appropriate for this exercise, but because, I assume, the n_components parameter would need to be well over the recommended value of 100 to affect this dataset, that step has been forgone.\n"

    "#### Analysis\n",
    "The accuracies were much better for lower n-gram values.  The best results came from using an n-gram range of 1-2 with an accuracy of 88.9% using a minimum document fequency of 0.0005, which was the lowest value tested that did not produce a matrix with more columns than rows.  Performance drops percipitously when the n-gram range is increased to 2-4 or 3, yielding results that are not much better than guessing (considering the class distribution of the given dataset).  The cross validation module often favored a higher value of C for the Logistic Regression model, usually equal to 0.99 or 0.95.  CV only selected a C of 0.9 when the min document frequency was higher, indicating that the cross validation was accounting for overfitting as more data was included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also consistently misclassified positive and negative reviews at roughly the same rate."

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "These results indicate that when using Logistic Regression and a dataset of this size, a lower n-gram is preferred and including as many features before degrading model performance is optimal.  This may indicate that the language of the reviews does not have much consistency on a 2-3 word basis or that phrases are used at the same rate within positive and negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge with this dataset is its high dimensionality.  While there are 50,000 data points, there are many more features, in this case n-grams, within this corpus.  Cleaning the data can involve many word transformations, as well detecting if a word is mispelled.  Even after the data is cleaned, we have to determine how much the data to use with the model to reduce the large amount of noise."

    "#### Further analysis\n",
    "While this model was able to achieve a roughly 90% accuracy across both classes, there are many more ways to improve on this, either by doing more feature engineering or using a more robust model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different models:  It would be worthwhile to try different models on the dataset.  An SVM would be appropriate because this is a binary classification problem.  However, I am also interested in the effects of measuring document similarity and using that for a clustering model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word attributes:  There are other qualities of the individual words that could be further processed.  For example, whether or not the average word length of a review is correlated to the sentiment of the review.  Other aspects could include the obscurity and if the words are mispelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "N-grams and phrases:  This implmentation is processing the data into different n-grams, but there could be more analysis done with n-grams.  Such as collecting longer n-grams (3 to 4 words) by sentiment of the review they appear in and weighting those phrases more while training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming:  I chose not to include stemming because the nltk libraries were producing too many non words, but it would definitely be worthwhile to invest more time into applying stemming correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence structure:  The sentence structure used could be indicative of the document's sentiment.  One hypothesis is that negative reviews have more sentences written in the first person, such beginning with \"I think ...\"  We can also explore if positive or negative reviews are correlated with incorrectly or correctly structured sentences.
